Regarding Rest Template 
org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate 

It is a class provided by the Spring Framework that simplifies making HTTP requests to interact with RESTful web services.

It is a part of the Spring Web module and provides a convenient way to consume and interact with RESTful APIs.

With RestTemplate, you can perform various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,PATCH, and handle the responses from the server. It hides the complexities of working with low-level HTTP client libraries and provides a higher-level, more user-friendly interface.

Key features

HTTP Methods: RestTemplate supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and more. You can use these methods to interact with different endpoints of a RESTful API.

Request and Response Handling: It allows you to send HTTP requests and receive responses from the server. The responses can be handled in various formats, such as JSON, XML etc.

Request and Response Conversion: RestTemplate can automatically convert request and response objects to and from JSON, XML using message converters.

Error Handling: It provides built-in error handling for common HTTP status codes and exceptions, making it easy to handle errors and exceptions that occur during HTTP interactions.

Authentication: RestTemplate supports various authentication mechanisms, such as basic authentication, OAuth, ..


Integration with Spring's Ecosystem: RestTemplate integrates well with other components in the Spring ecosystem, such as Spring Boot, Spring Security, and more.

eg : 
In any service layer , to call some other REST API 


        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        String apiUrl = "http://api.shop.com/product/{pid}";

        // Make a GET request and retrieve the response as a Product
        Product p = restTemplate.getForObject(apiUrl, Product.class,10);//product id=10

        System.out.println("API Response: " + response);
    }
}
From Spring 5, onwards ,  Spring recommends using the WebClient class, which provides a more modern and flexible way to interact with RESTful services.
